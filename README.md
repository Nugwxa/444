The purpose of this project was to serve as a tool for determining the effectiveness of brain training apps. Despite evidence of cognitive training's effectiveness in numerous areas and demographics, the assumption of brain training’s effectiveness in improving cognitive skills has been questioned. There are few studies that have analysed the difference in training results among different age groups and how long training effects last.  I used commercially available training tasks that were adopted to tap into working memory to fill this gap in the literature. Pre-training and post-training tests were used to assess the training's effectiveness.
## Games

For this project, I developed two cognitive games to aid the research. I used a collection of training tasks that were initially produced for the commercially 
accessible cognitive training application Cambridge Cognition to select and apply them to the 
games. The tasks chosen by the researcher were similar to those commonly employed in 
cognitive research.
All testing sessions to determine the effectiveness of cognitive training with video games were 
performed by participants from their homes. 

### Game 1

This was created to assess users' cognitive ability; there are 15 levels with two separate memory 
tests; a digit span and spatial span test.

### Game 2

This was created to improve users' cognitive ability; there are 30 levels, 15 digit span levels and 
15 spatial span levels to enhance the participants’ cognitive skills. This game used both the digit 
span and spatial span modes from game 1; however, unlike in game 1, the game started from 
an easy level requiring users to remember just one sound or pattern to more advanced levels 
where users had to recognise up to 5 sounds or patterns. This was designed to ensure users 
developed skills to scale through the levels.
